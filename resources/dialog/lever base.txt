	title: start
	---
	You see the base of a lever. Its handle seems to be missing.
	---
	if has_item($itemId) and quest_in_progress($questId) // Not really necessary to check for quest_in_progress.
		[[complete_quest_task($questId) | Place the lever into the base. | finish]]

<node>
	title: finish
	---
	You place the lever into its base and pull back. The door screeches and lifts upwards, opening up the path forward.
