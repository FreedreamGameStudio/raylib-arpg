## To Do

- [  ] Make terrain texture take into account the cursor's radius for spell casting
- [  ] Cylinders should be able to be placed on floor.
- [  ] Make game loop (waves going through portals)
- [  ] Animations need some form of queue/priority queue. (In system: a map of entity -> AnimationEnum).
- [  ]  Add multiple rotated billboards as part of the particle system to see if that helps the blending from behind etc. (Look at thinmatrix video for hints, too).
- [  ]  Add decals with TextureTerrainOverlay on fireball hit
- [  ]  Lightning effect with rotated additive texture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVQDUcr6dwo
- [  ]  If camera cant see renderable, dont render it
- [  ]  If camera cant see animation, do not "UpdateAnimation" (Keep ticking the animation counter)
- [  ]  Add towers
- [  ]  Be able to place towers via player abilities

----
- [ x ]  There is a bug where if an enemy is dying and you hit them then they get back up
- [ x ]  Add a top/tailed cylinder and that fire effect with the gradient and you should get a nice shockwave type effect
- [ x ]  Rotate a mask of a texture and you should get the swipe you want
- [ x ]  CursorAbility should check if the move is "valid" before confirm is accepted (the ability indicator can decide what is valid or not?)
