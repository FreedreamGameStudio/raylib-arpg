[Click here for a video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-uz78O3suk?si=V0p-T_p45XrW0Ecw)

The beginnings of an action RPG engine written in C++, using raylib and entt as its foundations. The end goal is to have
similar gameplay to 'Dungeon Siege' or 'Torchlight' (but much smaller in scale). Currently, model loading, animations,
camera movement, contextual cursors, pathfinding and the beginnings of an combat, state and dialogue system have been
implemented.

Please note: To build this project you will need to provide your own assets.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the underlying code of this engine to potential employers and those
interested in its inner-workings. This repository is source-available for viewing and demonstration purposes only. The
code is not currently open source.
